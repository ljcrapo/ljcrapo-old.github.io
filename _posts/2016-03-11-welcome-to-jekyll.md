I've decided to start a blog about my experiences as I experiment with different frameworks and technologies.

First post, of course, will be about Using GitHub Pages and Jekyll. I've grown fond of the simplicity of Markdown and decided to try it out. Jekyll is built on Ruby and uses Sass as its CSS pre-processor. I personally am a fan of Node.js and Less so this has ben a learning experience for me so far. I may find a different engine for my blogs in the future but this suffices for now.
